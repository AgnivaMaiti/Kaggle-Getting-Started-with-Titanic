# Kaggle Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This notebook is designed to analyze the Titanic dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset includes passenger details such as age, sex, fare, ticket class, and survival status. The goal is to explore the dataset, perform data preprocessing, and extract meaningful insights.

## Files in Dataset
The dataset includes the following CSV files:
- `train.csv` - Training data used for model building
- `test.csv` - Test data used for model evaluation
- `gender_submission.csv` - Example submission file

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the notebook:
```python
import numpy as np  # Linear algebra
import pandas as pd  # Data processing, CSV file I/O
import os  # File handling
```

## Steps in the Notebook
1. **Listing Dataset Files**
   - Uses `os.walk('/kaggle/input')` to list all available files in the dataset directory.

2. **Loading the Dataset**
   - Reads `train.csv` using `pd.read_csv()` and displays the first few rows to understand the structure.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) [To be added]**
   - Summarizing data, handling missing values, visualizing distributions.

4. **Data Preprocessing [To be added]**
   - Encoding categorical variables, filling missing values, feature scaling.

5. **Model Training & Evaluation [To be added]**
   - Implementing machine learning models to predict survival status.

## Notes
- The dataset contains missing values in the `Age` and `Cabin` columns, which need proper handling.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering steps can significantly improve model performance.

## Future Enhancements
- Add visualizations for better insights.
- Experiment with different machine learning models.
- Optimize hyperparameters for improved accuracy.

## Running the Notebook
Simply run each cell sequentially in Kaggle's environment to execute the analysis.
